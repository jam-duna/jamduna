## `no_std` compatibility

In order to take advantage of `no_std` builds, downstream users of this crate
must enable:

* the `spin_no_std` feature of the `lazy_static` crate; and
* the `no_std` feature of the `typenum` crate.

This is needed because the `--no-default-features` builds of these crates still
rely on `std`.
